## Project Overview

Android Studio and the Kotlin Language were used to create my app called PlanMeal. The app's primary purpose is to to help my friend, Hera , by providing her with Food suggestions throughout the day , e.g Morning, Mid-Morning , etc.
The app was created to fulfill the requirements of the assignment, which involves building a fully operational mobile app and implementing version control via GitHub, along with CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
The app intends to make the user feel excited to make meals while making it fun to use.

## Challenges with Program
- Logical errors occured but ultimately the program was resolved and updated with the help of my lecturer Kincade Garanganga and Jessel Sookha, as well as internet resources
- 











## Future Improvements
- The app will present 2 or more activity screens to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.
- The user will be given ingredients and thereafter provided with options to create various meal types based on their interest at the time.
- An addition of a launch screen that will provide feedback when an application is loading.
