## Project Overview

Android Studio and the Kotlin Language were used to create my app called PlanMeal. The app's primary purpose is to to help my friend, Hera , by providing her with Food suggestions throughout the day , e.g Morning, Mid-Morning , etc.
The app was created to fulfill the requirements of the assignment, which involves building a fully operational mobile app and implementing version control via GitHub, along with CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
The app intends to make the user feel excited to make meals while making it fun to use.
-------------------

## Challenges 
- Logical errors occured but ultimately the program was resolved and updated with the help of my lecturer Kincade Garanganga and Jessel Sookha, as well as internet resources listed in the reference list.
- Errors occurred while commiting and pushing my program to GitHub via File explorer. However, as i persisted in pushing through Android Studio- with additional guidance from my lecturer , Kincade- the changes eventually reflected in the repository.
-------------------







## Key Elements of The App
The app operates on a time-based system, meaning that when a user selects a specific time of day, it suggest a meal suited to that moment.
There is a *clear button* - this removes the user input , *exit button* - the user goes out of the application smoothly without crashing, *check result button* - this reveals what the user has inputed giving them a meal suggested based on time of day , *Textview* - a greeting that is interactive as it evokes an emotion to the user (Hera) making the app more personal and specific to the users needs, additionally, a *Descriptive guide* in the display for Hera ,that shows her what to look for and where to go in the Textview directing her to the user input.

## Future Improvements
- The app will present 2 or more activity screens to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.
- The user will be given ingredients and thereafter provided with options to create various meal types based on their interest at the time.
- An addition of a launch screen that will provide feedback when an application is loading.
